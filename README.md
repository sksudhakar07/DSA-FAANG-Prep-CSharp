# DSA-FAANG-Prep-CSharp

This repository is designed to help with **FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google)** interview preparation using **C#**. It contains solutions to essential **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** (DSA) problems, including common interview questions, mock interview practice, and system design concepts.

## Structure:
- **Array Algorithms** (e.g., Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Sorting)
- **Linked Lists** (e.g., Reversal, Cycle Detection, Merging Lists)
- **Trees & Graphs** (e.g., Binary Search Tree, DFS, BFS, Shortest Path Algorithms)
- **Dynamic Programming** (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Subsequence)
- **Bit Manipulation** (e.g., Single Number, Power of Two)
- **Practice Problems** from **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and other platforms
- **System Design** (Basic principles and interview problems)

## Topics Covered:
- **Arrays**: Sorting, Searching, Subarrays, etc.
- **Linked Lists**: Operations, Cycle Detection, Merging, Reversal.
- **Trees**: Binary Search Trees (BST), Traversals, Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA).
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, Shortest Path Algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Recursion, Memoization, Tabulation.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, etc.
- **System Design**: High-level design of scalable systems, databases, caching, etc.
